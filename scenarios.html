                        1962 Nazi Germany has most of Europe under its control, Japan has its respective empire in Asia controlling a portion of the continent and some ex-American territories such as the Philippines, Hawaii, a port in LA and a port in San Francisco. Italy has created its Mediterranean dream with an alliance between Turkey, the Iberian Union and it’s holdings across the Mediterranean. Russia has been shattered in dozens if not hundreds of warlords with many prominent ones remaining and bidingfor control of their respective territories. With the three ex-allies (Japan, Germany and Italy) being powerhouses they seem to be on top of the world however there are cracks being formed everywhere. Germany’s economic failures of the 50’s and its aging fuher have led to many of his previous loyal commanders fighting over the role of fuhrer while he’s still alive. Germany’s colonies and the SS have been difficult for the federal government to control due to their huge size and the aging administration. Due to this the United States has set up its own alliance of countries still free from Japan and Germany, the Organization of Free Nations (OFN for short).

                        A past left forgotten is a cave of mysteries and shadows waiting to be discovered for the entirety of the world to discover piece by piece in a consistent fear of what has happened rather than what will happen to oneself. It is now time to discover the fears and look for the intruders of the anomalies which haunt ourselves. The world now long regards the past as a thing that is great but never remembers the pain that was brought with the nostalgia and the trauma that can be found when one takes off the skin of the monster which keeps us all trapped within ourselves as the film is coming out to the public. The movie will be released soon in theaters near you. It is something eerie that can remind you of the hours spent late into the night watching air bud alone feeling as though one could be seeing the past of what could’ve been rather than what has been done. It's time to discover your past, it's time to confront your anomalies. Through this, you might just remember who you are at the basic level regardless of how you feel that you can be preseneted as if you were selling a product that everyone needed but noone bought because of scarcity of resources in the world.
